    The Word Count Function
    counts the words in the document with disregard to the case of the letters in words and
    puts them into a dictionary.
    
    The function ignores the strings that can be converted to floats and integers. 
    
    NOTE! You can reassign the default file in prompt by activating the line above the function code and deactivating the first line of the function.
